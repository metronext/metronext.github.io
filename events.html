						  <h2>Metro NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) Workshop 2024</h2>
                          <p>November 8, 2024  on Zoom (Link provided after registering below) </p>
						  <h3>The Workshop</h3>
						  <p>The Metro NExT Workshop is a mathematics pedagogy and professional development workshop that is open for <strong>all</strong> graduate students, postdocs, and early-career mathematicians in the NYC metro area.  </p>
						  <p>The workshop is also open to anyone who might be interested in learning about new teaching techniques and in making connections with other math educators. You do not have to be a Metro NExT Fellow to attend.</p>
						  <p>The workshop is sponsored and organized by the <a href="http://sections.maa.org/metrony/">Metro NY Section of the MAA</a> and hosted via Zoom.
							   There is <strong>no fee</strong> to attend the workshop. You can register here: <a href="https://forms.gle/rtJMTJRKxoNVkLhu7">https://forms.gle/rtJMTJRKxoNVkLhu7</a></p>

							<p><strong>A Mathematician in a Non-Traditional Department. </strong> <br> Dr. Sherli Koshy, Touro University Nevada  </p>
							
							In this session, I will present how one can use mathematical biology research projects in a medical
							university to provide non-math students a fulfilling research experience. I will talk about different
							research projects which used open-source software and existing data sets. Through the projects, the
							student learnt about ODEs, parallel computing, translation of ODEs to agent-based models, optimization
							techniques, data visualizations, and basic statistical techniques. The students were able to create high
							quality research presentations and contribute to manuscripts, enhance computer programming skills,
							and become proficient in the software. From this session, faculty will get an idea of how they may
							collaborate with medical universities in their area and students will get a flavor of the different kinds of
							math research.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Short Bio</strong>
							<br>
							Dr. Koshy-Chenthittayil’s background as a mathematical educator and researcher for the past decade
							has given her a unique perspective into the STEM student experience as well as the data driving this
							experience. She currently works as the Data Analyst with the Office of Institutional Effectiveness at
							Touro University Nevada, where she advises and helps coordinate faculty and students on a diversity of
							biomedical, institutional, and educational projects. She also serves as an Adjunct Instructor for the
							Educational Doctorate program where she oversees the Quantitative Research Methods class. During
							her time at the university, she has co-authored multiple manuscripts and poster presentations in both
							evidence synthesis projects and STEMM education. She also currently serves as the Chair for the
							Education and Outreach Committee for the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and is the
							recipient of the AWM’s 2021 Service Award.
