					                       <h2>About</h2>
                                 <p>Metro NExT (New Experiences in Teaching) is a local version of <a href='https://www.maa.org'><u>MAA</u></a>'s <a href='https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/professional-development/project-next'><u>Project NExT</u></a>, a professional development program for new or recent Ph.D.s in mathematics.  Our goal is to build a community of new faculty and graduate students in the <a href="http://sections.maa.org/metrony/"><u>NY Metro MAA Section</u></a> to help each other develop effective strategies for all aspects of our professional lives from teaching to research to service.</p>
								 <p>Metro NExT is open to all faculty members in or around the Metro NY-area who teach mathematics and have non-tenure track or pre-tenure status at a post-secondary institution. Metro NExT is also open to all graduate mathematics or mathematics education students in their final two years of doctoral study.</p>
                                 <p>We meet twice a year, at the Metro NExT Workshop in the fall and at the Section Meeting in the spring (see the <a href='events.html'><u>events</u></a> page for upcoming meetings information). Fellows in the Metro NExT program will:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Attend the Metro NExT Workshop in the fall.
									<li>Be members of a list-serve to help create networks for sharing ideas and supporting others.
									<li>Present at the following Metro NExT Workshop in the fall or at the Section Meeting in the spring.
									<li>Be actively involved in organizing the Metro NExT Workshop.
									<li>Have the registration fees for the Section Meeting waived during their first two years.
									<li>Be considered for the Metro NExT Professional Development Grant.
									</ul>
								<p>There is no cost for being part of Metro NExT.  Qualified individuals interested in becoming a <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/5zYQgP5e9VC0tRmz1'><u>fellow</u></a> and local faculty interested in becoming a <a href='https://goo.gl/forms/SjCzmLhc76FanAgt2'><u>consultant</u></a> should complete and submit the appropriate application form (see the <a href='applications.html'><u> applications</u></a> page for more information).</p>
